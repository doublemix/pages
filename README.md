### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

#### PR Deploy Previews

Every pull request automatically generates a preview deployment, allowing you to test changes before merging:

- **Automatic Deployment**: When you open or update a PR, a preview site is automatically deployed
- **Preview URL**: A comment with the preview URL will be posted on your PR (e.g., `https://doublemix.github.io/pages/pr-preview/pr-123/`)
- **Updates**: The preview site updates automatically with each new commit to the PR
- **Cleanup**: Preview sites are automatically removed when the PR is closed or merged

This enables:
- Testing changes in a real environment before merging
- Easier code reviews with visual verification
- Catching potential issues early in the development process
